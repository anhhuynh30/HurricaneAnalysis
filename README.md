# Hurricane Analysis

The main purpose of this project is for me to learn and practice writing Python's functions, manipulating string, as well as using conditionals, lists, and dictionaries.

In this project, 9 different functions will be written to organize and manipulate data about **Category 5 Hurricanes**, the strongest hurricanes as rated by their wind speed. 

Data of the hurricanes are stored in 7 different lists, which are:

1. names of hurricanes 

2. months of hurricanes

3. years of hurricanes

4. maximum sustained winds (mph) of hurricanes

5. areas affected by each hurricane

6. damages (USD($)) of hurricanes

7. deaths for each hurricane
